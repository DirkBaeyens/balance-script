      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This is not a religion, not a rulebook, not a belief system. It is the middle line. A path of balance, shaped by wisdom, not power. Understandable by every human. Translatable into any language. Like water flowing to every dry corner of the world — to refresh, not erase.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reality – What Is</h2>
      <p>We are part of a world built on cycles. Light and dark. Growth and decay. Action and rest. Reality is not what we desire it to be — it is what exists, with or without us. We must start by seeing clearly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Truth – What Endures</h2>
      <p>Truth is the fine line that survives every collapse. It is not owned by any side. It lives in the space between — where humility, respect, and understanding meet. It is the core of the balance buffer.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Logic – What Works</h2>
      <p>Balance is not an idea. It is a working method. Logic is the bridge between values and reality. It lets systems thrive without domination, lets differences coexist without destruction.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Balance Rule – 25 / 50 / 25</h2>
      <p>25% destructive extreme, 25% idealistic extreme. Between them: a 50% buffer that contains, filters, and forges a fine middle line. This is where the script lives. This is the only sustainable path forward.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Middle Script</h2>
      <div class="quote">
        “Let it not be forced, but found. <br />
        Let it not be claimed, but shared. <br />
        Let it flow where imbalance hides. <br />
        Let it refresh, not erase.”
      </div>
      <p>The script is not static. It learns, it adapts. It uses the good to neutralize the bad. It allows both to exist without destroying the other. It speaks the spirit of the old god, adapted for the present world.</p>

      <h2>How to Live It</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Empathize with all life — not just humans</li>
        <li>Balance energy: give, take, renew</li>
        <li>Govern through cycles — include all voices</li>
        <li>Invest in the base, not only the peak</li>
        <li>Treat nature as a partner, not a tool</li>
      </ul>
